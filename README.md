# VendingMachine Decentralised Application 
A decentralized vending machine on a Ethereum-based blockchain; users are able to buy and then restock donuts using Ether. The following technology is utilized: **Truffle**, for developing and deploying smart contracts; **Web3.js**, handling the interactions with the blockchain; and **MetaMask** for wallet interactions. Smart contracts are deplyoed to the **Sepolia Ethereum Testnet**.


## Features
- **Buy Donuts**: Users can purchase donuts by interacting with the smart contract and paying with Ether.
- **Restock Donuts**: "Owners" can restock donuts by sending transactions to the smart contract.
- **Wallet Connection**: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the decentralized application (DApp).
- **Real-Time Inventory**: Displays vending machine inventory and the user's donut balance in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Truffle**: Ethereum development framework for writing and testing smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library for blockchain interaction.
- **Next.js**: React framework for building the frontend.
- **Bulma CSS**: CSS framework for styling.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet for interacting with the DApp.
- **Sepolia Testnet**: Ethereum test network used for contract deployment.
